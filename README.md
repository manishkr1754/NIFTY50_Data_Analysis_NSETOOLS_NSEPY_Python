# Problem Statement
NIFTY50 Data Analysis from scratch (Data Extraction to Data Visualization)


    Tasks to be performed: 
    1. Use nsetools/nsepy to download NSE/NIFTY50 data (daily data) for last 15 years. Use for loop and time sleep for 1 min
    2. If possible, download the 1 year 5min data for NIFTY50
    3. Data Visualization : plots to visualize the trends over the last one year and so. Go for cufflinks and plotly
    4. How many times NIFTY gave a gap-up or gap-down opening and what dates
    5. Add on column- (High-Low)
    6. Add another column- (Movement from open)
    7. "Perchange_prev_close" 
    8. Calculate 7days/14days/21 days/50 days and 200 days exponential moving averages
    9. Plot the historical data (for one month for example) using candlesticks
    10. Heikin aashi candle data( as separate df). Try to calculate using python code and create it as a function

# Approach
Extracted 15 years NIFTY50 data using **nsepy/nsetools**, performed **technical analysis**, used **Cufflinks** and **Plotly** for interactive **candlestick** and **Heikin Ashi charts**

# Outcome
Understood NIFTY50 trends through interactive data visualization, providing investment insights
